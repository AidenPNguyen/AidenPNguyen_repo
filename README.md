## Project Overview

![large_CSTSU9yIOOOUDYmVy5-5-ZvX2-h_47TEGOE1Itff1SA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e18fb74-03b6-403d-8d45-848398586737)

Bali, a global tourist hotspot, faces serious water quality challenges that often lead to "Bali Belly," disrupting the dream holiday experience. In response, locals and tourists heavily rely on bottled water, which worsens the island's growing plastic waste problem. To tackle both water contamination and pollution, the Balinese government is rolling out water refill and recycling stations across the island.

Our solution, Bagus Tetes, is a mobile app designed to support this initiative. The app helps users easily locate nearby refill and recycling stations with real-time updates, reducing dependence on plastic bottles. It also promotes sustainable practices through health alerts, educational content, and a rewards system for eco-friendly actions. Users can further support the environment by participating in community clean-ups and ordering safe water for delivery or pickup.

## Project background

Despite government efforts to reduce bottled water use in Bali, concerns over tap water safety have hindered success (IF-Water, 2023). Nearly 42% of urban residents and many tourists still rely on bottled water due to fears of contamination (Cole & Browne, 2015), worsened by the fact that 59% of Indonesia’s rivers are severely polluted, impacting groundwater sources (The Environment and Forestry Ministry, 2021).

To address these issues, the Balinese government, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Indonesian environmental organization IDEP, has developed a water recycling and filtration system (The Bali Sun, 2023). This initiative integrates with a mobile app that helps users locate filtration stations, access regularly updated water quality reports (Tripadvisor, 2023), and receive push notifications on environmental and pollution issues.

By providing safe drinking water access and promoting awareness of environmental protection, the project aims to reduce reliance on bottled water, cut plastic waste, and foster eco-friendly practices among locals and tourists alike.

## Project goals and objectives

The goal of this project is to address Bali’s growing water pollution crisis, largely driven by tourism, and to promote sustainable practices among visitors and locals. Bali’s popularity as a top vacation spot has placed immense pressure on its natural resources, particularly water, while contributing significantly to plastic waste.

Key Objectives:
- Assess the impact of tourism on water resources:
> Analyze tourist data to understand how the influx of visitors affects Bali’s water supply and pollution levels.

### Why Bali?

Bali ranks 19th among the world’s top tourist destinations, attracting 8.26 million international visitors annually (Global Destination Cities Index 2019). It is one of the few large-scale tourist attractions in Southeast Asia, alongside major cities like Bangkok, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. This high volume of tourism puts immense pressure on Bali's natural resources, particularly its water quality, making it an ideal location to study the environmental effects of tourism.

The heavy tourist influx has led to significant challenges in maintaining clean and accessible water resources. Understanding the impact of tourism on Bali’s environment is crucial to developing sustainable solutions. Given Bali's unique status as a globally recognized destination, this research will contribute to the island's long-term environmental protection and support sustainable tourism practices.

### Tourist persona

This is our persona information which was generated based on the real experiences of many Australian tourist coming to Bali before. As being shown in the persona board, Jack had to undergo some negative points since he struggled with using clean water for daily basic needs, all he can do is using bottled water for alternative option which can cause more and more consumption and increase plastic waste.

## Our works
### Data preprocessing

For this project, we have collected and filtered extensive data from various sources, including real-world reports and generated datasets, to monitor and compare Bali's environmental pollution and water quality with other provinces in Indonesia. The data is categorized across several areas, including biological indicators and tourism-related factors:

- Water Pollution and Quality Metrics:

Biological data include BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand), COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), TSS (Total Suspended Solids), fecal coliform levels, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, salinity, and pH levels. These indicators help identify pollution hotspots in Bali's rivers, beaches, and water supply.

- Tourism and Population Data:

Tourist arrivals (in millions) to Bali and other global destinations.

Tourism-related pollutants, including waste contributions from agricultural, industrial, and coastal activities.

Population growth and its impact on waste and water resource infrastructure.

- Water Safety and Accessibility:

This data tracks the availability of safe drinking and bathing water zones, along with improvements in water treatment infrastructure across various locations. It also includes sources of water used by both tourists and locals, such as refill stations, wells, and bottled water consumption.

- Tourism Risk Factors:

A separate dataset highlights travel risks by measuring sickness reports from tourists, vaccination recommendations, and key health risks at various attractions.

- Disease Reports:

We collected data on common waterborne and travel-related diseases reported in Bali, including illnesses like dysentery, typhoid, and other conditions linked to poor water quality.

### Data Visualizations

#### *Bali and other tourist attractions*

![alt text](worldmap.png) 

As can be seen from this map, Bali is ranked the second worst in water pollution
among the ten most visited city destinations in 2020 with a score of 60.23 out of 100.

> This high rating indicates a seriously eroded water quality that has drawn attention from inhabitants of the area as well as tourists. The score obtained shows that water pollution in Bali is a severe problem that requires attention by everyone.

![alt text](visitingcompound.png) 

- Bali is the fastest-growing tourist destination, with a 10% compound annual growth rate and 6.28 million international visitors in 2022 (Bali Tourism Statistics, 2023). However, this rapid growth has intensified environmental challenges, particularly water pollution, which threatens the island’s long-term appeal as a tourist hotspot.

- In comparison, Bangkok has a growth rate of 6.6%, attracting millions of tourists each year. While Bangkok is better equipped to handle tourism pressures, Bali's higher growth rate could soon surpass Bangkok's visitor numbers.

- Kuala Lumpur, on the other hand, has experienced slower but steady growth at 1.0%. Despite being a popular destination, its tourism progress lags behind both Bali and Bangkok.

> Addressing Bali’s environmental concerns is critical to sustaining its success as a leading tourist destination.

#### *WHO Safety Standard for drinking water quality comparing to Bali's case*

![alt text](drinking.png)

The chart compares nitrate and phosphate levels in Bali's water to WHO safety limits for drinking water (WHO, 2022), revealing key health risks:

- Nitrate Levels:
> The WHO limit is 10 mg/L, but Bali's nitrate levels were 15.5 mg/L in 2019, decreased slightly to 11.48 mg/L in 2020, and rose to 19.08 mg/L by 2023. High nitrate levels can cause serious health risks, such as methemoglobinemia ('blue baby disease'), largely due to agricultural runoff and untreated sewage.

- Phosphate Levels:
> The WHO limit is 0.1 mg/L, but Bali’s phosphate levels have remained significantly higher, peaking at 3.92 mg/L in 2022 and slightly dropping to 3.75 mg/L in 2023. Excessive phosphate contributes to harmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion in water bodies, primarily caused by untreated sewage and agricultural waste.

![alt text](bathing.png) 

The chart highlights four key water quality indicators – BOD, COD, fecal coliforms, and TSS – compared to World Health Organization (WHO) standards for safe bathing water (WHO, 2021). The trends in Bali show significant pollution concerns:

- BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand):
> BOD measures the amount of oxygen required by organisms to break down organic material. The WHO limit is 3 mg/L, but in Bali, BOD levels rose to 5.57 mg/L in 2022 and remained high at 5.12 mg/L in 2023. This indicates severe organic pollution caused by urbanization and tourism, potentially harming aquatic life and making the water unsuitable for swimming.

- COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand):
> COD measures the total oxygen needed to oxidize both organic and inorganic material. The safe limit is 50 mg/L, but Bali's levels have consistently exceeded this, peaking at 85.57 mg/L in 2023. This points to increasing industrial pollution and untreated sewage discharge.

- Fecal Coliforms (E. coli):
> Fecal coliform levels, linked to human and animal waste, must not exceed 200 MPN/100mL. Bali maintained safe levels until 2022, but the levels spiked to 250.1 MPN/100mL and further to 300.6 MPN/100mL in 2023, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.

- TSS (Total Suspended Solids):
> TSS, which consists of suspended particles in water, should not exceed 25 mg/L for safe bathing. Bali's TSS levels rose above this threshold in 2021, reaching 45.12 mg/L in 2023. High TSS reduces water clarity, harms aquatic ecosystems, and is linked to soil erosion and construction from tourism activities.

#### *The impact from tourists*

![alt text](<water quality.png>)

1. Rising Nitrate Levels

Nitrate levels rose from 15.5 mg/L in 2019 to 19.08 mg/L in 2023, linked to agricultural runoff, untreated wastewater, and nutrient discharge from hotels and restaurants.

- Eutrophication (oxygen depletion) harms marine life.
- Affects fisheries and water-related tourism activities.

2. Phosphate Contamination

Phosphate levels exceeded safe limits, reaching 3.75 mg/L in 2023. Sources include untreated waste and chemicals from tourist properties.

- Negative Effects:

- Causes harmful algal blooms, reducing water quality.

- Damages marine ecosystems and discourages tourism at affected beaches.

3. Organic Pollution (BOD & COD)

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD): BOD increased to 5.12 mg/L by 2023 due to organic waste like sewage and food debris from tourist activities.

Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): COD rose to 85.57 mg/L in 2023 due to detergent and chemical waste from tourist accommodations.

- Depletes dissolved oxygen, killing marine life.

- Deteriorates coastal water quality, reducing Bali's appeal to environmentally conscious tourists.

4. Water Treatment Infrastructure Strain

Water treatment infrastructure is under pressure, with performance dropping from -7.12% in 2019 to -9.12% in 2023. Tourism growth has outpaced the capacity of existing water management systems.

- Accumulation of pollutants worsens water quality.
- Insufficient treatment facilities threaten Bali's reputation as a premier tourist destination.

#### *The severe consquences*

In 2023, Bali ranked third among tourist destinations for sickness posts, with 7,567 reports, significantly higher than the average of 3,355.9 sickness posts in other tourist areas (Cyrus, 2024).
- High Sickness Activity:

> Poor water quality is a major factor contributing to these sickness posts. Many tourists and locals come into contact with contaminated water through recreational activities or by consuming unsafe water.

- Health Risks:

> This contamination increases the risk of waterborne diseases, particularly for those using or consuming untreated water, leading to a higher rate of illness reports in the region.

![alt text](vax.png)

#### *Local residents and tourist temporary approaches*

The bubble charts highlight the main water sources used by Bali’s residents and tourists, emphasizing both safe and temporary measures.

- Bottled/Refill Water:

Usage: 28.00% and 27.20%

> Heavy reliance on bottled water reflects concerns over the safety of tap and well water. Though convenient, it’s costly and contributes to plastic pollution (Environment Ministry, 2021).

- Protected Wells:

Usage: 15.70-16.00% in dwellings, 12.10-12.40% in yards/plots.

> These wells provide safer options than open wells but highlight the insufficient trust in piped water systems.

- Piped Water:

Usage: 9.00-9.50%.

> Issues with water treatment infrastructure limit its use and reliability.

- Natural Sources (Springs and Rainwater):

Springs usage: 10.10%

Rainwater usage: 2.70%

These are primarily used in rural areas where other water sources are inaccessible.

## Conclusion

This report presents a comprehensive plan to tackle Bali’s critical water crisis, focusing on two key issues: limited access to safe drinking and bathing water and the escalating plastic pollution problem. These challenges are intensified by the island's booming tourism industry, which strains its natural resources.

Our research and data analysis revealed the interconnected nature of these issues. Visualizations highlighted the severity of the crisis, including high rates of travel-related illnesses, rapid tourism growth, and resource depletion. These findings emphasize the need for immediate action to protect public health and the environment.

To address these problems, we designed a human-centered mobile application. The app provides real-time access to water filtration stations, tracks plastic waste reduction, and encourages sustainable practices among tourists and locals. By reducing the reliance on bottled water, the app aims to improve water safety and promote environmental awareness.

We also outlined essential technologies, features, and next steps to scale the project. By focusing on local engagement and sustainability, this initiative has the potential to reduce the impacts of Bali’s water crisis and support a more sustainable future for the island.
